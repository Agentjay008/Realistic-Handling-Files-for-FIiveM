This contains realistic handling files for some of the most commonly used police vehicles in FiveM and LSPDFR, including Chargers, FPIUs, etc. 

These handling files are supposed to be REALISTIC, which means all cars acceleration and handling will behave to as close to IRL as possible. 

There are also two fxmanifest versions included to replace your current fxmanifest.lua or _resource.lua if it does not include an entry for the HANDLING_FILE. 
Version 1 is for vehicle resources that do NOT have the .meta files inside a 'data' folder. 
Version 2 is for vehicle resources that DO have .meta files inside a 'data' folder. 

MAKE SURE TO RENAME WHICHEVER ONE YOU USE TO 'fxmanifest.lua'.


Unzip the folder. 

Pick the handling file that fits your vehicle and place it in your vehicle resource folder. 

Open your 'vehicles.meta' file and make sure to change the "handling id" section to the name of the vehicle inside the 'handling.meta' file.

EXAMPLE:
<modelName>fpiu</modelName>
<txdName>fpiu</txdName>
<handlingId>FPIU</handlingId> <<<HERE>>>
<gameName>fpiu</gameName>



Rename the handling file to 'handling.meta' otherwise it WILL NOT work. 

For example, rename '2020fpiuhandling.meta' to 'handling.meta'.

Make sure to "refresh" in your server before restarting the vehicle resource if you have replaced the fxmanifest.lua.
